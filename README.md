# Health Burden Index for Texas Cities (CDC PLACES Data, 2024 Release)
## Overview
This project analyzes city-level health burdens across Texas using the **CDC PLACES Local 2024 dataset**, which is based on 2022 BRFSS data. A custom **Health Burden Index (HBI)** was developed to assess the combined impact of four key health indicators: **obesity**, **diabetes**, **smoking**, and **depression**.

The goal is to identify cities with the highest health burden and explore patterns that can inform public health priorities and interventions.

## Objectives
* Calculate a Health Burden Index for each city in Texas
* Compare cities across Texas using HBI
* Provide insights and recommendations for public health planning
* Highlight high-burden areas with clear, map-based visualizations

## Dataset Structure
The final dataset was derived from two tables within the same dataset file from the **CDC PLACES Local 2024 dataset**. One table contained health indicators (e.g. **obesity**, **diabetes**, **smoking**, and **depression**) and their values, while the other provided population counts. Both tables were linked using a common identifier, **LocationId**, to create a unified dataset for analysis.

---

- Filtered to Texas cities with population > 500
- Created a Health Burden Index = average of the 4 indicators

### 2. Data Formatting & Exploration (Google Sheets)
- Added population estimates using VLOOKUP
- Labeled cities by health burden level (High / Moderate / Low)
- Applied conditional formatting for quick visual scanning

### 3. Visualization (Tableau)
- Mapped all cities in Texas with geographic coordinates
- Applied color gradients by Health Burden Index
- Highlighted high-burden cities
- Annotated cities using labels and tooltips

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Cities with the highest HBI are often smaller or mid-sized with limited population.
- Depression and obesity were consistent contributors in most high-burden cities.
- Urban centers generally had lower burden, but not always â€” highlighting disparities.

## âœ… Recommendations

- Prioritize health education and intervention efforts in identified **high-burden cities**.
- Support mental health infrastructure in regions with elevated depression rates.
- Encourage community-level data use to support targeted policy and funding.
